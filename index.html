But I have listened to the instructions you have given to answer certain questions like K map, Assertion Reason, 5 mark code, etc.<br><br>In addition to Computer Science, you have taught me other things that will stay in my mind throughout my life. You have given many suggestions and tips for my college studies and my job. I don\'t know if I can follow them (I\'m still confused about my future), but I\'ll try my best. These two years\' memories are incomplete without you. I\'ll be in touch over the years. I keep praying all day for the school, the students, and teachers.<br><br>Thank you for being our computer teacher and school vice principal.
